# Law-garithm

## Your AI-powered legal assistant

Law-gorithms is an AI-powered legal document assistant designed to make complex legal documents understandable for common citizens. Legal documents such as contracts, notices, agreements, and court orders are often written in technical language that is difficult for non-lawyers to interpret. Law-gorithms bridges this gap by transforming legal jargon into clear, plain-English explanations.

In addition to summarization, Law-gorithms offers an interactive chatbot that allows users to ask questions about the uploaded document. 
Law-gorithms prioritizes safety, transparency, and accessibility. It does not replace lawyers but empowers users with better understanding and legal awareness.
